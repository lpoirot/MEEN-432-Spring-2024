The regen breaking violation will be triggered. 
I was not able to figure out the gain that should go to the APP% such that the regen breaking violation is not passed.
Whenever I passed a percentage of the breaking (usually around 90) to the APP %, the entire car broke and made huge ovals at speeds of ~270 m/s.
