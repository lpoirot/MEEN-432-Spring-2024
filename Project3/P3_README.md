# Project 3 Week 1 Update
Instructions for Running Week 1:
1. Download the files from the week 1 folder
2. Run init.m
3. Run initDriveCycle.m
4. Run p3_runsim.m

#Work Done Week 1:
1. Imported demo code for init.m, initDriveCycle.m, and p3_runsim.m
2. Extended the Urban drive cycle test to contain the entire data set and simulated the data with our model
3. Simulated our model on the Highway drive cycle data
4. In p3_w1_car, iteratively adjusted PID controller proportional, integral, and derivative gains until the vehicle error is less than 3 mph throughout the cycle
	- ***Proportional gain: 0.1 (old) -> 0.5 (new)
	- ***Integral gain:     0.0 (old) -> 0.0 (kept same)
	- ***Derivative gain:   0.0 (old) -> 0.0 (kept same)

# Project 3 Week 2 Update
Instructions for Running Week 2:
1. Delete the files downloaded from the week 1 folder (we do not want the upcoming downloads to save as new names)
2. Download the files from the week 2 folder
3. Run init.m
4. Run initDriveCycle.m
5. Run p3_runsim.m
6. Run P3init.m

Work Done Week 2:
1. Used code from week 1 and imported demo code for P3init.m
2. In P3init.m, removed the commenting out of the plotting code for electric motor/transmission data (contour plot)
3. Outputted the angular velocity and torque from the Simulink model
4. Added in a calculation to predict the energy consumed by the vehicle when driving on the two EPA cycles
