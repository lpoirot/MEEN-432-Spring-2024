# Project 2 Week 1 Update
Begin by downloading the file in the project 2 folder called "P2_Week1_Update" as well as the rotate function.
Run the code.
You should see a car that makes its way around a NASCAR-like track, with its path traced behind it.

## Week 1 Feedback (3.8/5)
The rotate function was used in your script but it was not added to the submission so it did not run the simulation properly. I assume you have the function and forgot to submit it. For Week 2, start developing a lateral dynamic model of a vehicle that contains subsystems that are listed in the Week 2 document.

# Project 2 Week 2 Update
Begin by downloading all files in the project 2 folder.
Run the initialization file "init" first.
After, run the file labeled "P2_Week2_Update"
After entering the number of desired laps, the code will produce the car's speed while its driving by plotting it.

Work done:
Imported the Simulink demo file including the driver model, the lateral dynamics model, and transformation/rotation subsystems. 
Defined the tloops function and the raceStat.m file.
Adjusted parameter to ensure the car remains on the track.
Adjusted parameters to ensure fastest lap time.
