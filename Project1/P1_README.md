For project 1, begin by downloading both the matlab and simulink files present in the repository. 
After downloading the files, run the matlab code
Enter which solver you would like to use exactly as it is asked for.
When all simulations are completed , the plot will open
Allow for a few seconds to let the graphs fit to the full screen size

## Week 1 Feedback (5/5):
Before anything else. please make sure to put your Project 1 work within it's respective folder! What this team did is super cool, I loved the way y'all had user input and the loading screen in the command window. While this is extremely cool, I'm not sure if it would be efficient for the overall project since there are multiple solvers we would want to use (fixed time and variable time). However, you guys are within the rules of the project since you give proper instructions to get the response/plots needed. So I say keep it going, and as long as you give sufficient instructions to run everything to get the deliverables I will give you full credit. Now for feedback, everything works great so start considering how to add logic (either to MATLAB scripts or Simulink models) to determine if appplied torque is constant or sinusoidal since that adds extra variables (frequency and time). 


Project 1 Week 2 Update:
For project 1 week 2, begin by downloading both the matlab and simulink files present in the repository. 
After downloading the files, run the matlab code
The code does 256 simulations, so it might take some time to succesfully run. When all simulations are completed , the plot will open
Allow for a few seconds to let the graphs fit to the full screen size

## Week 2 Feedback (5/5)
The Simulink models were not uploaded for this weeks deliverables so I was unable to run your week 2 script. Looking at previous commits, I believe this is because the P1_demo.slx file name was changed to just P1_demo which deleted the Simulink model. However, I remember this team's week 1 deliverables so I believe that you guys were able to fully complete Part 1. I won't take points off for this week, but please make sure to double or even triple check that all the files are correctly submitted. Assuming Part 1 is complete, now your team should be looking into Part 2. For part 2, the team will need to create different simulink models for the 3 options on how to connect System 2 to System 1. I would suggest copying the model you have now for Part 1 and modifying it for the different options. Once the entire project is complete, makes sure to commit all Part 1 and Part 2 files with the commit message "Project 1 Final" NOTE: If you want to resubmit your Simulink model so that I can check the script just email me when you make the change and I'll try to update my feedback before the final submission date
