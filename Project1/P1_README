For project 1, begin by downloading both the matlab and simulink files present in the repository. 
After downloading the files, run the matlab code
Enter "euler" or "runge-kutta" to specify which solver you would like to use (all lowercase)
The code will display how far along it is, and when all graphs are generated, the plot will open
Allow for a few seconds to let the graphs fit to the full screen size
The different variable values are displayed above each graph, and the different time steps are represented by different colored lines

## Week 1 Feedback (5/5):
Before anything else. please make sure to put your Project 1 work within it's respective folder! What this team did is super cool, I loved the way y'all had user input and the loading screen in the command window. While this is extremely cool, I'm not sure if it would be efficient for the overall project since there are multiple solvers we would want to use (fixed time and variable time). However, you guys are within the rules of the project since you give proper instructions to get the response/plots needed. So I say keep it going, and as long as you give sufficient instructions to run everything to get the deliverables I will give you full credit. Now for feedback, everything works great so start considering how to add logic (either to MATLAB scripts or Simulink models) to determine if appplied torque is constant or sinusoidal since that adds extra variables (frequency and time).
