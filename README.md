For project 1, begin by downloading both the matlab and simulink files present in the repository. 
After downloading the files, run the matlab code
Enter "euler" or "runge-kutta" to specify which solver you would like to use (all lowercase)
The code will display how far along it is, and when all graphs are generated, the plot will open
Allow for a few seconds to let the graphs fit to the full screen size
The different variable values are displayed above each graph, and the different time steps are represented by different colored lines
